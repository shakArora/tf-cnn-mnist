# tf-cnn-mnist
used tensorflow and mnist database to train a triple layered CNN

by the way do NOT use tensorflow, torch is much better but my ssh would not authorize so i had to use tensorflow ðŸ’€

do pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy and make sure you can use mnist or just install your own db

also try to keep epochs low because theres 938 training images per epoch
